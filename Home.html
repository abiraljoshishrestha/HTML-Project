		<h1 style="font-size: 36px;"><em>Hello, there!</em></h1>
		<p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: justify;margin:40px;">I am Abiral Joshi Shrestha. Currently, my primary focus is on my education. Besides that, I'm also involved in the start-up of an online musical website known as Index. Now, what is Index? You might be wondering. In my own words, Index is a community of artists and visionaries, who create and document depictions of art and culture. It is a community which sets the spotlight on inventive and often controversial ideas as well as personalities. With this regards, I, personally, am also a musician and a vocalist.</p>
