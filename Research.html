		<h1 style="font-size: 20px;"><em>In order to create this website and webpages a lot of research was done. Clues were taken from many webpages. Some  of them are:</em></h1>
		<p><b>1) Index.com</b>
		 <a href="http://itsonindex.com/"> Go to Index</a></br>
		 <img src="screenshot1.jpg" width="1100px" height="500px" ></br>
		 This is the website of the start-up that I am working on. Many of the information on the home page of my own website is about this multi-platform network.
		</p>
		<p><b>2) w3schools.com</b>
			<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> Go to W3 Schools</a></br>
			<img src="screenshot2.jpg" width="1100 px" height="500px"></br>
				A lot of the confusions that I had were removed by referencing to this page. It contains critical information regarding the syntax of both HTML and CSS. Referencing this website helped me remove many errors that I had run into.
		</p>
		<p><b>3) W3Schools Template </b>
			<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm">Go to the Template</a></br>
			<img src="screenshot3.jpg" width="1100px" height="500px"></br>
			This template has been wonderfully programmed and designed. The navigation bar used in my own website was inspired by the one used in this template. It also gave me an idea on how my website should be designed.
		</p>
		<p><b>4) Achieve 3000 </b>
		<a href="http://www.achieve3000.com/customer-support/"> Go to Achieve 3000</a></br>
		<img src="screenshot4.jpg" width="1100px" height="500px"></br>
		Referencing this website was very helpful to me as it gave me a clear concept of what is required in the contact page. It also helped me understand how a form should be structured.
		</p>
		<p><b>5) Wix </b>
		<a href="https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1676/?siteId=a2b2ea31-fa89-4af6-839a-0152c05a239e&metaSiteId=25696c7e-f948-43cc-a307-463d74bcc52d&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv"> Go to Wix</a></br>
		<img src="screenshot5.jpg" width="1100px" height="500px"></br>
		I referred to this website in order to get some idea about how to create my own CV. I also look at the concepts and ideas regarding portfolio.
